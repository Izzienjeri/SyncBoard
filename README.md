# Student Management Dashboard - SyncBoard

A modern, feature-rich dashboard built with Next.js and TypeScript to demonstrate full-stack CRUD capabilities. This project goes beyond a simple to-do list to manage students, teachers, and subjects, featuring data visualizations and a polished, responsive UI.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Full CRUD:** Manage Students, Teachers, and Subjects.
*   **Data-Rich Dashboard:** Interactive charts for attendance and grade distribution.
*   **Server-Side Logic:** Searching, sorting, and pagination are handled by the API for better performance.
*   **Robust Forms:** A single reusable modal handles create/update operations, with validation by Zod.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Built with Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui, including dark mode and loading skeletons.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Logic is abstracted into custom hooks (`useUserManagement`) for DRY, maintainable components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 14 & TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
*   **Data Fetching:** SWR
*   **Form Validation:** Zod
*   **Charts:** Recharts
*   **Mock Data:** Faker.js

## üí° Why a Custom Mock API?

The project instructions suggested an external API like DummyJSON. However, a custom mock API was built using Next.js Route Handlers to address specific project requirements that a generic service could not meet:

1.  **Relational Data:** To model relationships between entities (e.g., assigning a `Teacher` to a `Subject`).
2.  **Custom Endpoints:** To create specific data for dashboard widgets, like a `/stats` endpoint for calculating pass rates.
3.  **Demonstrate Full-Stack Skills:** To implement server-side logic for searching and sorting, which is a more realistic and scalable approach.

This decision enabled a more complex and feature-rich application that better showcases end-to-end development capabilities.
